## 4. Practices
##### Practice 1: Array
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Print all the elements with format:
```
Output:
print 1
print 2                                              
print 3                                              
print 4                                              
print 5
```
- Count the number of elements in the array
```
Output: 5
```
- Add the number 6 to the array
```
Output: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
- Remove 1 from the array
```
Output: arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
- Get the element at the 3rd position
```
Output: 5
```
- Get the element at the last position
```
Output: 6
```
- Get the first 3 elements
```
Output: [2, 3, 4]
```
- Check if array contains 10?
```
Output: false
```
- Sum the elements in the array:
```
Output: 20
```
