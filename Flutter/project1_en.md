   [Review Template](https://sal.vn/YZHBxP)
2. If approved by the trainer, design a prototype on:
   [Figma](https://www.figma.com)
   Then submit for trainer review. If approved, proceed to step 3.
3. Break tasks as per the template, prioritize, and ensure each task takes less than 4 hours:
   [Task Template](https://sal.vn/XscfSi)
   After trainer approval, inform the trainer to provide a Redmine project (to import tasks instead of using a sheet). Once tasks are on Redmine, submit for trainer review.

4. Upon receiving the GitHub repository, create an initial pull request with:
   - Template pull request
   - Template project [here](https://github.com/awesome-academy/Flutter-template)
5. After approval and merging of the initial pull request, create subsequent pull requests and submit for trainer review.

#### NOTE:

- Slides are available on S-Learn's "Flutter" course: https://tiv.wsm.vn/learn/vi/course/1503/
- Subsequent pull requests should not exceed 20 file changes and 500 lines of code.
- Team members must cross-review and approve each other's pull requests.
- Only after successful cross-reviews, submit the pull request for trainer review.

## 3. Add Tasks on Redmine + Estimate Time

- Register a Redmine account at [this site](https://edu-redmine.sun-asterisk.vn/) and provide the information to the trainer.

#### Note:

- Refer to the account naming [here](https://github.com/framgia/Training-Guideline/blob/master/Rails/RegisterEduRedmine.png).
- Each task estimate should not exceed 4 hours. For larger tasks, divide them into multiple tickets.
- Follow the process for changing the status of a ticket [here](https://github.com/framgia/Training-Guideline/blob/master/WorkingProcess/redmine/redmine.md).

#### Ticket Status Transition Procedure:

1. All tasks must be created as Redmine tickets before starting work.
2. Redmine tickets must be filled with Category, Target Version, Parent task, Start date, Due date, Estimated time.
3. Developer takes the ticket, changes the status to "In Progress."
4. After completion, submit a pull request, update the Redmine ticket with the pull request link, change %DONE to 90%.
5. The pull request is sent to the entire team for review.
6. The pull request must be reviewed and approved by a team member before being sent for trainer review.
7. Upon merge, the developer updates %DONE of the Redmine ticket to 100% and changes the status to Resolved.

## 4. Project Review

- Project review is allowed when the team has completed >= 85% of the required project functionalities.
- Always actively seek and incorporate feedback from the trainer and others.
- If the team completes less than 85% of the requirements, contact the trainer two days before the deadline to request a schedule extension and additional time.

#### Happy coding!!!
